This is assigment fore The Odin Project,
where I build a balanced Binary Search Tree in JavaScript.

I built a Node and Tree Class add method, so you can add, remove find values, organise the tree in different orders and rebalnce it after adding more nodes. As well I wrote a function to creare a random array.
